## Projects

`2018.07 - 2019.03`
**HR++ ( Human Resource Management System )**

> Rococo Co., Ltd.   Software Engineer ( Intern )

- This project is a highly customizable HRMS solution for Rococo Ningbo. Use *Spring framework* to simplify the code. For web front-end uses *Angular* and *React* for PC and mobile adaptations respectively. We use *Docker*, *Jenkins*, etc. for containerized management and continuous integration. There are highly customizable function modules, fuzzy search, hardware integration, approval workflows, and other features.
- I am responsible for some of the business development of the system, as well as the main design and development of the mobile web side. Integrate *Flowable* to simplify the development of the approval process features of the system. Independently complete the resume collection system, resume information extraction (emails from platforms like Linkedin and Seek, etc.) and abstract a unified interface for extension. Implemented the automatic calculation of the leave module, leave duration according to the office hours and holidays.
- Used *Yeoman* tool to generate simple CRUD template code for the system, avoiding repeated copying and pasting, which greatly simplified the development process.
- Worked with product managers to translate the English language package of the system.
- Currently the system has been delivered to more than 10 companies and received a lot of positive feedback, especially the resume analysis module was well received by them.

**POI-POJO Utilities**

- This is a sub-project of HR++. Use *Apache POI Framework*, Java reflection and annotation to convert directly between simple Excel file and POJO.

**[Kaggle Microsoft Malware Prediction](https://github.com/shawnking07/microsoft-malware-prediction)**

- This is a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction)
- We implemented data preprocessing, baseline classification, feature engineering.
- Use *LightGBM* decision tree algorithm to classify the data.

**[Burrows-Wheeler transform Encoding, Inversing, and Searching](https://github.com/shawnking07/BWT_implementation)**

- This is an assignment for COMP9319 Web Data Compression & Search
- Implemented BWT inversing and searching for DNA sequence.
- This course also introduces some popular compression and searching algorithms, like *Arithmetic coding*, *Adaptive Huffman Tree*, *Linear-time Suffix Array*, etc.
